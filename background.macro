{{Acolyte (Follower of Garyx)=Garyx is the dragon god of fire, destruction, and renewal.  Garyx symbolizes the sheer power and destructive force of dragonkind.  Some argue that Garyx is actually insane.  Garyx pays little or no attention to his clerics and worshippers, but they do not care. Some druids revere the renewing aspect of Garyx, knowing that devastation is necessary for rejuvenation to occur.}}
